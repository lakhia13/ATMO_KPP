# ATmopheric Model One-dimentional - KPP Conversion (ATMO\_KPP)

### 1. Introduction

**ATMO_KPP** is a one-dimensional model used to calculate concentrations of chemical species over the atmosphere. 
This model is translated from a Fortran one-dimensional model designed by Toyota, K. et al.

### 2. Features

In addition to all original features, this Python conversion adds a GUI with built-in format conversion and 
plotting functions.

### 3. Installation & Usage

ATMO\_KPP requires the following packages

    python3-tk
    numpy
    netcdf4
    pandas
    xarray
    matplotlib

Once all packages are installed, download all code and run GUI.py
